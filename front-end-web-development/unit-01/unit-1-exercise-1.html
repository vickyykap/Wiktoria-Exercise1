    <p>Hi, I'm Vicky and originally I am from Poland but have lived in Ireland for most of my life. I currently work as a Web Coordinator, where I mostly use page builders to manage and create websites. While I enjoy my role, I’ve always had a passion for web development and want to deepen my knowledge by learning the fundamentals and skills needed to work more directly with code.</p>
